Nagios Asterisk Python plugin for checking active calls, active channel and calls processed.

A very basic rewrite of a subset of the wonderful nagisk plugin found at : http://blog.nicolargo.com/2008/10/superviser-asterisk-dans-nagios-grace-a-nagisk.html

One can use the same steps to make it working as the tutorial from nicolargo.

That was all I needed the plugin to do and I much prefer python.
